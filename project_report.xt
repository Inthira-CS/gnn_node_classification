PROJECT REPORT: NODE CLASSIFICATION USING GCN
====================================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed for node classification tasks. The system processes graph-structured data where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships, assigning each node to one of four predefined categories.

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The project is built using a modular Pythonic structure:
* Data Module: Generates the graph topology and node features.
* Model Module: Contains the GCN architecture definition.
* Training Module: Handles the optimization logic and loss calculation.
* Evaluation Module: Computes performance metrics (Accuracy and F1-score).



3. MODEL SPECIFICATIONS
The model architecture and training parameters are configured as follows:
* Hidden Layers: 64 hidden units.
* Output Classes: 4 distinct categories.
* Dropout Rate: 0.5 (applied to prevent overfitting).
* Optimizer: Adam.
* Learning Rate: 0.01.

4. METHODOLOGY
The execution follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
* Graph Initialization: Loading node features (x) and adjacency matrices (edge_index).
* Training: The model learns spatial representations through multiple message-passing iterations.
* Evaluation: Post-training, the model is switched to evaluation mode to generate predictions on the test set mask.

5. RESULTS & METRICS
The model performance is quantified using:
* Test Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly predicted node labels.
* Test F1-Score: Provides a balanced view of precision and recall across all four classes.
